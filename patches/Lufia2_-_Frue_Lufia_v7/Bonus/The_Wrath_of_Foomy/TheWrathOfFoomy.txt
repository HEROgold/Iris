 Back in 2005 relnqshd created the Foomy patch
 together with help from ti83magic and SinclairC
 where you can fight against Foomy the Foomistral.

 Now, it's finally time for the second round.
 After rainponcho trying to deal with the Capsule
 Monsters' fastidiousness and snobbishness, the mighty
 Foomy made silly Daos believe he could control and use
 him - and now replaces the final boss fight in order
 to bring death, chaos, destruction and terror upon thee!


 This patch is the same as Frue Lufia (v7.0)
 except that instead of Daos you will fight Foomy as the final boss.

 Name:                  HP:      MP:    ATP:   DFP:    AGL:  INT:  GUT:  MGR:  DROP:
 Snoomy               50000        0    2000  10000    510   510   510   510   Nothing

 He is incredibly strong and you'll really need a miracle to survive that onslaught...
 (There also are some more or less subtle changes regarding Erim, Egg Dragon and Master.)
