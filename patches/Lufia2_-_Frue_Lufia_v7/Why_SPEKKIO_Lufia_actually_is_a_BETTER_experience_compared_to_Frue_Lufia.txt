 First of all, if you don't enjoy the battle system and doing combat with all your heart, you will not like
 Spekkio at the end of the day. Better play Frue then, period. At the endgame you really need a decent grasp
 of all of Lufia 2's battle system mechanics. That is, if you get overwhelmed your first thought better is
 "How can I optimize my strategies and tactics?" instead of "I have to grind to level 99 and farm stat potions
 for hours!". Especially the final battles just are not free and will never be, regardless of how much you may
 grind. If you don't like what you've read: Just go for Frue Lufia then. That said, why do I favor Spekkio?


 Short version:

 #0 - just overall better game design:

  - unlike Frue Lufia, which only does by-the-book changes, Spekkio also deals with some GAME DESIGN ISSUES

  - in Spekkio Lufia there are only a few, but MEANINGFUL changes

  - Spekkio Lufia really has more SOUL compared to cookie-cutter approached Frue Lufia


 Longer version:


 #1 - way less fake difficulty / tedium / pure luck:

  - first and foremost, the Iris Items appear WAY more frequently
    (as these items add absolutely nothing gameplay-wise)

  - in the Gift Mode you can easier obtain blue chest items by being able to buy exactly what you wish
    (so that Gift Mode actually feels rewarding - without forcing you to grind/farm your whole equipment again)

  - the final regular enemies in the Ancient Cave drop some actually useful stuff - at non-ridiculous drop rates
    (so that, despite the Master himself being harder, the Ancient Cave overall becomes way less luck-based)


 #2 - better overall balancing:

  - at the end there are regular battles that examine whether you really UNDERSTOOD the combat system

  - there are optional super boss battles that examine whether you really MASTERED the combat system


 #3 - better learning experience:

  - you actually can learn about the Ancient Cave Master's behaviour BEFORE you encounter him for the first time

  - you're told in-game that there's the possibility to block status ailments solely by wearing proper equipment
    (as well as you're told one specific example in order to block instant death)
