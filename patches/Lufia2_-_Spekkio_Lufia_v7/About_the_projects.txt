 
 The project patches include a lot of various bug
 fixing patches so you don't have to bother to use
 all of these patches on your own.

 The following patches are used for Frue Lufia,
 Spekkio Lufia and Kureji Lufia, as well as
 for The New Fierce Battle and The Wrath of Foomy,
 but not for the Danger Nose patch:
