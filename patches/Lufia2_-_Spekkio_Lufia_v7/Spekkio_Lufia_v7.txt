            ******************************************************

 Spekkio Lufia is almost the same as Frue Lufia, but there are a few differences.
 There are some modified battles which are the Master and the Egg Dragon battle
 as well as the last battles against the Sinistrals and some late game bosses.
 Besides, non-boss Ghost Ships will summon Krakens, Night Lizards and Deathbringers,
 whereas Dark Summoners will summon King Hydras, High Hydras and Lucifers.
 (And Dark Summoners now are immune to instant death.)
 Also, in the newest version Iris Treasures will appear more frequently,
 in the Gratze basement the prisoners sell items and give you a Revive in case you lack one
 and in the Gift Mode (which is available from start) you can buy blue chest items.

 Quite notable, Artea and Lexis now can equip Miracle Plates/Mails so that everyone
 has the potential to get an armor in the Ancient Cave right from the start.

 Also quite notable, Silver and Gold Dragons now drop Dekar and Myth Blades (~10%).
 However, the AGL of the Metal Dragons is increased by factor 1.5 now.

 Besides, Orochis drop Taplowses now (~25%). As well as Blue Dragons now have
 Magic Fruits as a rare drop (~0.25%) whereas some bosses have higher drop rates
 as well as Web Spiders drop Ear Picks (~25%) and Gold Golems drop Hammer Rods (~1%).
 And No Cores now can drop Engage Rings (~7.5%) as well as the elder of Narvick
 now sells some rings after the last maiden has joined the party. And the stuff from
 Chaed's weapon shop is no longer missable as you can buy it in Gruberik now.

 However, some words about the battles:


 1) The Master

 The Master has now a new additional move which makes the battle a little bit
 harder as he can now heal himself completely every round. And suicide isn't
 an option anymore. Therefore, the only way is to bring him down in one single
 round. Or is there maybe another way as well...?

 
 Name:                  HP:      MP:    ATP:   DFP:    AGL:  INT:  GUT:  MGR:  DROP:
 Master               10000 infinite      10      1    510   510   510     2   ---


 2) The Sinistrals

 The Sinistrals are also a little bit more difficult. However, they are nothing
 a good level 50-party or even a level 40-party can't handle.
 
 Name:                  HP:      MP:    ATP:   DFP:    AGL:  INT:  GUT:  MGR:  DROP:
 Gades                30000        0    1000   1000    510   510   510   510   ---
 Amon                 30000    10000    1000   1000    510   510   510   510   ---
 Erim                 45000    10000    1500   1000    510   510   510   510   ---
 Daos                 50000    10000    1500   1000    510   510   510   510   ---

 There's also a surprise battle during the course of the game. And Erim and Daos
 might have some surprises for higher leveled ones as well.


 3) The Egg Dragon

 He's the name giver of this patch as he now - like Spekkio from Chrono Trigger -
 changes his behaviour depending on the highest level of a party member.

 There are 8 different versions you can fight:

 - level 01-39: basically the original fight

 - level 40-49: Scrambled Egg's attack power can't be lowered anymore + higher confusion rate

 - level 50-59: now he has two turns per round + more spells + Cinder Blast

 - level 60-69: can silence you and has single-targeted spells

 - level 70-79: has Diamond Dust and Scrambled Egg drains MP as well

 - level 80-89: now he has 3 turns per round + the Dread spell

 - level 90-98: has Stardust Blow + ATP & DFP lowering attacks

 - level 99:    ????????

 Name:                  HP:      MP:    ATP:   DFP:    AGL:  INT:  GUT:  MGR:  DROP:
 Egg Dragon           65535 infinite    1500   2000    510   510   510   510   Myth Blade


 4) La Puella

 La Puella, the beloved pet of the Princess of Parcelyte, Cefia, is a new enemy
 unique to Spekkio Lufia. You can fight her whenever you want after beating Gades
 in the Ancient Tower. Just go to the throne room of Parcelyte Castle and talk to her.
 Do you stand a chance against La Puella and everything which joins the battle?

 Name:                  HP:      MP:    ATP:   DFP:    AGL:  INT:  GUT:  MGR:  DROP:
 La Puella            30000    10000    1000   1000    320   510   510   510   Spider Jewel
 Pet Dragon            7500     5000    1000   1000    320   510   510   510   Engage Ring
 Lady Spider           5000        0    1000   1000    510   510   510   510   Jute/Warding Helm
 Queen Spider          5000        0    1000   1000    510   510   510   510   Power/Spirit Brace


 Maybe the Spiderweb IP move might be helpful against some of them. Good luck! ^_^
