 Notable non-bugfixing and non-translation changes:



  General changes:

   - Retry and Gift Mode are available right from start

   - Capsule Monsters sometimes demand a Wave Ring

   - when fighting Erim the bridge disappears, so there's no way else to go aside from straightly facing Daos


  Item/Shop changes:

   - Miracles heal 16383 instead of only 999 HP/MP (also applies to Frue Lufia)

   - Gruberik's weapon shop sells the same as the Chaed shop after its annihilation (and nothing beforehand)
   - one of the prisoners in the Gratze basement always gives you a Revive in case you don't have one
   - the other one of the prisoners in the Gratze basement also sells a few very basic items
   - the Narvick elder provides Mystery/Curio, Ghost and Sea Rings after the final maiden joined your party

   - the Ancient Cave red chest distribution is fixed (for sure a bug, but totally worth the special mention)

   - Iris Items have a higher frequency to appear in red chests
   - you can buy all of the blue chest items in Gift Mode

     - Illumination (Mage Shield)

     - Weakener (Safety First)

   - Rage/Fury Knife only is equipable by Tia and Selan, but its IP move costs less IP
   - Dragon Blade has a critical hit chance of 50% instead of only 25%, but it's somewhat more expensive
   - Silver Eye's Diamond Dust is a little bit stronger and Gold Eye's Stardust Blow costs slightly less IP

   - Miracle Plate/Mail also is equipable by Lexis and Artea

   - Pearl Brace when worn reduces anti-sea damage instead of fire damage (and Camu uses anti-sea attacks)
