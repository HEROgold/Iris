**************************************************************************************
GENERAL NOTES
**************************************************************************************

In the Spekkio Lufia patch the Egg Dragon
chooses his whole behaviour depending on
the highest level of a party member
(just like Spekkio from Chrono Trigger).

This is the version of the Egg Dragon
that you will fight if the highest level
of a party member is below 40.

It's basically the same fight as in the
original version. However, his Zap and
Over Easy moves are slightly stronger
as well as Over Easy's probability
of inflicting confusion is slightly
higher, too.
