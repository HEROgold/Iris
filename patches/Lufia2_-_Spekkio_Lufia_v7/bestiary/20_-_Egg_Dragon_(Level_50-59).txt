**************************************************************************************
GENERAL NOTES
**************************************************************************************

In the Spekkio Lufia patch the Egg Dragon
chooses his whole behaviour depending on
the highest level of a party member
(just like Spekkio from Chrono Trigger).

This is the version of the Egg Dragon
that you will fight if the highest level
of a party member is in-between 50 and 59.

Now the Egg Dragon gets two turns per round
and he will cast the powerful spells Thunder,
Ice Valk, Dragon and Firebird which give
him quite an elementary variety.

His Scrambled Egg doesn't get weaker, of course.
And it isn't fire elemental any more so that
fire protection won't help any longer.

He also uses Cinder Blast known from the
Copper Dragons and it's really powerful -
especially considering your current level.
