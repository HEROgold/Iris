**************************************************************************************
GENERAL NOTES
**************************************************************************************

In the Spekkio Lufia patch the Egg Dragon
chooses his whole behaviour depending on
the highest level of a party member
(just like Spekkio from Chrono Trigger).

So this finally is the version of the Egg Dragon
that you will fight if the highest level
of a party member is none other than 99.

His attacks now are even worse than everything
else you can encounter in the Spekkio Lufia patch.
Scrambled Egg and Stardust Blow are as strong
as before and Sunny Side Up isn't any longer
weaker than Stardust Blow.

His Zap spell in the first turn now is replaced
by a magic attack called Onsen Tamago which
is quite a bit more dangerous, of course.

His Egg Slicer now is as strong as his Sunny
Side Up was in the original fight and it not only
lowers DFP even more than before, it also lowers
ATP quite a bit. Egg Pricker is almost the same,
only with reversed roles of ATP and DFP - thus
more focusing on lowering ATP instead of DFP.

Over Easy is still as powerful as before and now
inflicts both confusion and silence with perfect
accuracy.

However, most notable is his Kinder Sorpresa which
he performs every four rounds starting with Round 1.
Instead of having a fixed weakness he will change it
every four rounds - and of course all the other
elements will do piss-poor damage.

Besides, after losing some HP he will either get
a ridiculously strong physical or a ridiculously
strong magical defense whenever he uses Kinder
Sorpresa, so you better should take care of this.

And to make it even worse, neutral elemental attacks
will do completely no damage now. Therefore, stuff
like Battle Fury is completely useless.

Finally, when he has lost most of his HP, he will
replace a few of his most powerful multi-target moves
in favor of his final trump card - Egg of the Century.
This very last resort is as strong as Stardust Blow
or Sunny Side Up and cannot get reflected back under
any circumstances.
