GENERAL NOTES
**************************************************************************************

In Spekkio Lufia the red jellies have a completely
different behaviour compared to all the other versions.
Instead of just attacking regularly, now they will
fully heal themselves the first three times they get
a chance to perform their own action (in contrast to
actions induced by status ailments).

After that they will use an attack on themselves which
will high likely just kill them. However, if they survive,
they will just flee instead. (Though, the only real way
for the latter to happen is quite some intervening
from the player's side.)

The reason for this change of behaviour is in order to
prepare you at least a little bit for the Master Jelly
at the end of the Ancient Cave. (However, the other
different-coloured jellies stay with attacking you normally.)

Also, when you encounter Tia in the Lake Cave you fight
a bile jelly which is accompanied by three red jellies.
This bile jelly has the same stats as the goblin you would
have fought there normally (aside from having 12 MP).
