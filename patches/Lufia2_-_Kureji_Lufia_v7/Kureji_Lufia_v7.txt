 Kureji Lufia is a modified version of Lufia 2 - Rise of the Sinistrals.
 It changes all the not normal battles and makes them way more challenging.
 There are two patches with different difficulty which are both made
 for the US version.
 Besides, now for each difficulty there's an alternate version available
 which buffs up the regular enemies as well. (So, there are four patches
 now from which you can choose.)
 I also used most of the bugfixes made by relnqshd, so there won't be
 most of the known bugs, but I want to emphasize that this part isn't my work.


 I'd suggest to play it in Retry Mode. If you don't have a save,
 you can use the enclosed one. However, in the newest versions
 Gift Mode is available right at the beginning, anyway.

            *  Differences between the "fruely hardcore" patch:  *
            *                                                    *
            ******************************************************


 The main difference between the difficult and the fruely hardcore patch
 is that it's much easier to get the better equipment/items
 in the difficult version.

 This affects:

 a) the shops at Gruberik and Narvick and the new shop in Gratze
    as well as the casino at Forfeit Island (see below)

 b) some new monster drops and monster drop rates
    as well as the modified content from a few chests (see below)



 Battle-wise the only difference between the difficult and the fruely
 hardcore patch are the following six battles:

 1) Gades at Doom Island

 2) Amon at Doom Island

 3) Erim

 4) Daos

 5) Master

 6) Egg Dragon

 Especially Erim and Daos will pose a much bigger threat on Doom Island,
 but the battle which is changed the most is definitely the Egg Dragon battle.
 Not only does he have better stats and more aggressive moves,
 he also has a new and really devastating attack which he doesn't use otherwise.

 Also in the fruely hardcore version there is a BOSS RUSH available
 at the end of the game as soon as you get the final maiden in Narvick.
 Just visit the throne room of Parcelyte Castle whenever you're ready.
