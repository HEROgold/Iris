 This version is the same as the fruely hardcore version
 with the regular enemies buffed as well.

 But, the lizards at the beginning now drop
 an Egg Ring with a drop chance of 100%.
 And you can also buy them in the Gratze basement.


 However, don't expect this version to be a complete joke
 as e. g. the Sinistrals at Doom Island, the Ancient Cave
 or the Egg Dragon still are quite tough.

 And there's also the boss rush...
