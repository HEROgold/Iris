  GENERAL INFORMATION:

  - the game can be perfectly won without any grinding or farming
    as long as you take on just every enemy you'll encounter
    (however, that is, excluding the optional stuff
     like Gades, the Ancient Cave or the Egg Dragon)

  - getting the Magma Key at Dragon Mountain actually seems to affect
    the damage formula regarding the factor for front and back row
    damage so that you'll get less damage in three of the four spots
    for party members ... for some reason (this also happens in vanilla)

  - you might want to buy VERY, VERY much stuff at the very end
    in order to properly prepare yourself for the endgame,
    but you can get basically infinite money from the Narvick elder

  - you also can get Engage Rings as a regular monster drop
    in order to shorten your shopping time significantly
    especially in the casinos

  - do never forget to unequip all your party members before they
    leave your party (that is, if it's feasible)

  - do never forget that you cannot leave the Gratze jail once you're
    imprisoned, so be especially careful with saving the game (there's a
    shop with a few goodies, but you're nevertheless stuck in that place)



  SHOPPING AND OBTAINABLE ITEMS:

  - there's some new stuff in some shops so especially better do not miss
    visiting Gruberik even if you don't plan going into the cave
    as there's temporarily no way to get there when you lose your ship

  - there are also a very few chest contents changed somewhere so you
    might want to check out especially minor caves as soon as possible

  - there's also a new shop in the Gratze jail which sells
    some basic stuff as well as some nice equipment

  - you can enter the Tanbel Tower before triggering Camu and therefore
    grab the three chests at the top before the boss battle
    (to a lesser extent it might be an alternative to visit
     the Tower of Truth or Dragon Mountain earlier for some good chests)

  - if you have problems with some bosses you might consider to go for
    the newly added or easier to get probability-wise monster drops
    as they really can help greatly in some cases
    (same as the new shop contents)


  - the stat increasing sources have some neat other property/properties
    which you might want to exploit

  - generally Speed Sources are really neat, but before using them
    you better be aware that they also are some kind of double-edged sword



  MISSABLES:

  - the stuff sold in Chaed is no longer missable, however, now you can
    miss the Kraken Rock drop from Squids in Gratze so if you care for
    more of them, there won't be another time to farm them afterwards
    (same for Curio Rings which are sold in Gratze and aren't farmable)

  - boss drops are basically guaranteed, but can actually get missed
    in case your inventory is full


  - when wishing from the Egg Dragon you should consider that you get
    - one Old Shield as boss drop
    - four Magic Fruits as boss drops
    - S-Curio Rings as regular drops
    - 4 of the 6 stat increasing sources by buying

  - the Light Jewel has a very useful IP move which, however, only helps
    that immensely against a really annoying boss if you have the proper
    additional equipment so you might consider that when making your wishes



  BATTLES:

  - some enemy moves have quite some unusual elemental property so you
    might want to experiment a little bit with your elemental shields
    (and helmets) in case a foe might turn out to be too overwhelming -
    this goes not only for boss battles but also for regular enemies
    especially in a certain cave

  - and, of course, do generally experiment with your equipment a lot
    especially regarding the automatic protection against status ailments



  ANCIENT CAVE:

  - better do the cave with Dekar (and Guy) in your team

  - you definitely might want a good arsenal of blue chest items
    before you really take on the cave

  - against the Master every capsule monster not in final form
    just will instantly flee (just like you lose all your IP)

  - I suggest Blaze (or Jelze) for the final battle
