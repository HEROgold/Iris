Yes, the range of every shop is set.
however, as you may notice in the rando the weapon and armor range may shift depending on the amount of items.
so there is one pointer to the shop table, the offsets are a set value, too.
what I basically did is to scan for the beginning of a shop marked with 9C.
If there is a magic shop it's always last in the shop chain ending on FF

this is  Elcid for example:

Items:
02 9C 00 02 00 05 00 0A 00 0B 00 0D 00 0F 00 18
00 19 00 1A 00 1D 00 1F 00 24 00 29 00 00 Weapons 00 38
00 00 Armor 00 E4 00 00 00 Spells  03 20 00 00 0E 15 FF

Shop sections are divided by 00 00 00, spells always begin with 03 20 00 and end on FF
By shifting the divider you can basically decide which shop contains how many items within that range
As a base to shop table you can always rely on BF09F as offset from your pointer base
if you want to get to the other shops you need either calculate the offset and add it to the pointer base or you do it like I did,
subtract the start of the entire shop table from the address where the respective shop starts,
that gives you an offset.
Add that to BF09F and you get the correct offset from the start of the shop table to the shop you want to map

"city": "Elcid",
      "weapon": "bf0a3-bf0c2",
      "armor": "bf0a3-bf0c2",
      "spell": "bf0c9 - bf0cd"
So you can pretty much rely on abyssonyms offset table
