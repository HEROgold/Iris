# Disclaimer

This project isn't finished yet! and in a alpha phase.
There are a lot of things that could get changed at any moment in time.
Furthermore there's a lot of lines that could use some refactoring, or fixing.

## State of project

Due to Universitry this project is being put to a pause.
there is however still plenty of time to review Pr's of fix some issues.

Most of this project/toolkit is in a usable state.
With Iris it should be quite quick to make custom (data related) patches.
(see patches/custom.py for examples)

## Supported patches

- Vanilla (unheadered/headered)
- GameGenie codes (applies them to rom)

## Planned Support

- Frue v7
